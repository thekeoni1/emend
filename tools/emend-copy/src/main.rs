//! emend-copy: opens a zip archive with the emend layer and writes it back.
//!
//! `specs/0008-zip-layer.md`, "Harness runs", and `specs/0009-package-
//! layer.md`, "Harness runs". At most ONE operation per invocation, given
//! after the two paths:
//!
//! - none: no edits, so the output must be byte-identical to the input and the
//!   harness must report every entry `identical` with an empty flags column.
//! - `--replace <name>`: the named entry is replaced by its OWN decompressed
//!   bytes, so the harness must report that entry `recompressed` (or
//!   `identical`) and every other entry `identical` and unflagged.
//! - `--xml-null-rewrite`: every entry whose name ends in `.xml` or `.rels`,
//!   ASCII case-insensitively, is replaced by its own bytes passed through
//!   `emend::xml::Stream`, the mark when present followed by every token's raw
//!   bytes. Each such entry must come back `recompressed` or `identical` and
//!   never `changed`, and every other entry `identical` and unflagged: the
//!   rewrite is the identity, so this is what proves the token stream loses
//!   nothing across the corpus.
//! - `--drop-calc-chain`: the recipe of `specs/0009-package-layer.md`,
//!   "Module `package`", applied through the package layer: the workbook's
//!   `calcChain` relationship, the `Override` for its target when the package
//!   has one, and the entry when the package has one, each its own call and
//!   nothing implicit. A VALID package with no chain records no edit, so its
//!   output must be byte-identical to its input; a package with one must come
//!   back with those three gone, the two rewritten parts `changed` and every
//!   other entry `identical` and unflagged. The content types part is read
//!   before the chain is looked for, so a package without one is refused here
//!   as `--survey` refuses it, whether or not its edit would be empty (part 2
//!   P3 verification ruling 6).
//! - `--survey`: no edit either, so the output must be byte-identical again,
//!   and one line goes to stdout: the word `survey` then tab-separated
//!   `key=value` pairs, COUNTS ONLY. The package layer's whole map is walked
//!   to produce them, so a corpus file whose content types, relationships,
//!   targets or sheets the layer cannot read is an error (exit 2) and the
//!   runner records the run as one. The line names no entry and no value from
//!   the workbook: a count is not content.
//!
//! The entry's bytes go to a temporary file and are handed to the layer as a
//! reader, through the `io::copy` wrapper, rather than being collected into
//! memory: a corpus entry can be tens of megabytes and `usize` is 32 bits on
//! the target that matters.
//!
//! Exit 0 on success, 2 on any error, with the message on stderr as
//! `error: ...`, matching `xlsx-diff` and `passthrough`. Messages name at
//! most an entry index: never a path, never an entry's content.
